# Design Patterns
Implementation of different design patterns through examples.
Each pattern has its own **md file** with documentation.

## Creational patterns
Deal with object creation:
- Abstract the object instantiation process
- Help with making your **system independent** of how its **objects are created**, composed and represented

**Patterns**:
- [Singleton](Singleton/Singleton.md)
- [Factory method](FactoryMethod/FactoryMethod.md)
- [Abstract factory](AbstractFactory/AbstractFactory.md)
- [Builder](Builder/Builder.md)
- [Prototype](Prototype/Prototype.md)

## Structural patterns
Deal with ways to define relations between classes or objects
- Concerned with how classes and objects are **composed to form larger structures**

**Patterns**:
- [Adapter](Adapter/Adapter.md)
- [Bridge](Bridge/Bridge.md)
- [Decorator](Decorator/Decorator.md)
- [Composite](Composite/Composite.md)
- [Facade](Facade/Facade.md)
- [Proxy](Proxy/Proxy.md)
- [Flyweight](Flyweight/Flyweight.md)

## Behavioral patterns
Deal with ways to communicate between classes or objects
- characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at runtime

**Patterns**:
- [Template method](TemplateMethod/TemplateMethod.md)
- [Strategy](Strategy/Strategy.md)
- [Command](Command/Command.md)
- [Memento](Memento/Memento.md)
- [Mediator](Mediator/Mediator.md)
- [Chain of Resposibility](ChainOfResponsibility/ChainOfResponsibility.md)
- [Observer](Observer/Observer.md)
- [State](State/State.md)
- [Iterator](Iterator/Iterator.md)
- [Visitor](Visitor/Visitor.md)
- [Interpreter](Interpreter/Interpreter.md)
