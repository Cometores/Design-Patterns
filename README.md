# Design Patterns
Implementation of different design patterns through examples.
Each pattern has its own **md file** with documentation.

## Creational patterns
Deal with object creation:
- Abstract the object instantiation process
- Help with making your **system independent** of how its **objects are created**, composed and represented

**Patterns**:
- [Singleton](Sources/Creational/Singleton/README.md)
- [Factory method](Sources/Creational/FactoryMethod/README.md)
- [Abstract factory](Sources/Creational/AbstractFactory/README.md)
- [Builder](Sources/Creational/Builder/README.md)
- [Prototype](Sources/Creational/Prototype/README.md)

## Structural patterns
Deal with ways to define relations between classes or objects
- Concerned with how classes and objects are **composed to form larger structures**

**Patterns**:
- [Adapter](Sources/Structural/Adapter/README.md)
- [Bridge](Sources/Structural/Bridge/README.md)
- [Decorator](Sources/Structural/Decorator/README.md)
- [Composite](Sources/Structural/Composite/README.md)
- [Facade](Sources/Structural/Facade/README.md)
- [Proxy](Sources/Structural/Proxy/README.md)
- [Flyweight](Sources/Structural/Flyweight/README.md)

## Behavioral patterns
Deal with ways to communicate between classes or objects
- characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at runtime

**Patterns**:
- [Template method](Sources/Behavioral/TemplateMethod/README.md)
- [Strategy](Sources/Behavioral/Strategy/README.md)
- [Command](Sources/Behavioral/Command/README.md)
- [Memento](Sources/Behavioral/Memento/README.md)
- [Mediator](Sources/Behavioral/Mediator/README.md)
- [Chain of Responsibility](Sources/Behavioral/ChainOfResponsibility/README.md)
- [Observer](Sources/Behavioral/Observer/README.md)
- [State](Sources/Behavioral/State/README.md)
- [Iterator](Sources/Behavioral/Iterator/README.md)
- [Visitor](Sources/Behavioral/Visitor/README.md)
- [Interpreter](Sources/Behavioral/Interpreter/README.md)
