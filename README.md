# Design Patterns
Implementation of different design patterns through examples.
Each pattern has its own **md file** with documentation.

## Creational patterns
Deal with object creation:
- Abstract the object instantiation process
- Help with making your **system independent** of how its **objects are created**, composed and represented

**Patterns**:
- [Singleton](Singleton/README.md)
- [Factory method](FactoryMethod/README.md)
- [Abstract factory](AbstractFactory/README.md)
- [Builder](Builder/README.md)
- [Prototype](Prototype/README.md)

## Structural patterns
Deal with ways to define relations between classes or objects
- Concerned with how classes and objects are **composed to form larger structures**

**Patterns**:
- [Adapter](Adapter/README.md)
- [Bridge](Bridge/README.md)
- [Decorator](Decorator/README.md)
- [Composite](Composite/README.md)
- [Facade](Facade/README.md)
- [Proxy](Proxy/README.md)
- [Flyweight](Flyweight/README.md)

## Behavioral patterns
Deal with ways to communicate between classes or objects
- characterize complex control flow that's difficult to follow at runtime

**Patterns**:
- [Template method](TemplateMethod/README.md)
- [Strategy](Strategy/README.md)
- [Command](Command/README.md)
- [Memento](Memento/README.md)
- [Mediator](Mediator/README.md)
- [Chain of Responsibility](ChainOfResponsibility/README.md)
- [Observer](Observer/README.md)
- [State](State/README.md)
- [Iterator](Iterator/README.md)
- [Visitor](Visitor/README.md)
- [Interpreter](Interpreter/README.md)
